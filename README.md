Leap OSC to MIDI for Osculator

This is an OSCulator mapping intended to be used with Nick Fox Gieg's [LeapToOSC processing library](https://github.com/N1ckFG/LeapToOsc). It simply demuxes the OSC message, and maps each finger and hand's X,Y, and Z positions to a midi signal, which can be used in programs like Ableton Live to drive audio and music effects.
